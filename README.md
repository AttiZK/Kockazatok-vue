# vue-express-postgresql

A full-stack web application built using Vue.js for the frontend, Express.js for the backend, and PostgreSQL as the database. This project showcases the integration of modern web technologies to create a robust task management system.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Vue.js 3 with Composition API, Vuetify for UI components, and Axios for HTTP requests.
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript for enhanced type safety and better developer experience.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, a powerful, open-source object-relational database system.

## Features

### Frontend

1. **Task Management**: Users can create, read, update, and delete tasks.
2. **Reactive UI**: Leveraging Vue's Composition API for reactive state management.
3. **Validation**: Implemented basic form validation to ensure data integrity.
4. **Modular Components**: UI is broken down into reusable Vue components.

### Backend

1. **RESTful API**: Designed endpoints following REST principles for CRUD operations.
2. **Type Safety**: Utilized TypeScript to ensure type safety and improve code quality.
3. **Database Integration**: Used `pg-promise` for seamless integration with PostgreSQL.
4. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling mechanisms in place to handle potential issues.
5. **CORS**: Integrated `restify-cors-middleware2` to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing for frontend-backend communication.

### Database

1. **Schema Design**: Created a tasks table with fields for id, title, and description.
2. **CRUD Operations**: Implemented SQL queries for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks.

## Challenges & Solutions

1. **CORS Issues**: Encountered CORS policy issues when trying to connect the frontend to the backend. Resolved by integrating CORS middleware in the Express server.
2. **Data Flow**: Ensured seamless data flow between components using Vue's props and events system.
3. **Database Integration**: Set up a connection pool for efficient querying and handled potential database errors gracefully.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Authentication**: Implement user authentication and authorization for added security.
2. **Pagination**: Add pagination to handle a large number of tasks.
3. **Search & Filter**: Implement task search and filter functionalities.
